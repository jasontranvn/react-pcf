## Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide to develop and test a PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) control. PCF allows developers to create custom components for model-driven and canvas apps in Power Apps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 10.x or later)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [PowerApps CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/get-powerapps-cli)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or your preferred code editor)
- [Microsoft Power Platform](https://make.powerapps.com/) account

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Node.js and NPM**
   - Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install PowerApps CLI**
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Run the following command to install the PowerApps CLI:
     ```bash
     npm install -g pac
     ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Run the following command to ensure the CLI is installed correctly:
     ```bash
     pac --version
     ```

## Creating a New PCF Project

1. **Create a New PCF Project**
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
   - Run the following command to create a new PCF project:
     ```bash
     pac pcf init --namespace YourNamespace --name YourControlName --template field
     ```
   - Replace `YourNamespace` and `YourControlName` with appropriate values.

2. **Install Project Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the newly created project directory:
     ```bash
     cd YourControlName
     ```
   - Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

## Developing the PCF

1. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**
   - Open your project directory in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.

2. **Edit the Manifest File**
   - Open the `ControlManifest.Input.xml` file.
   - Define the properties, resources, and configuration needed for your control.

3. **Develop the Control**
   - Implement the logic for your control in the `index.ts` file (located in the `src` folder).

## Testing the PCF

1. **Build the Control**
   - Run the following command to build your control:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

2. **Test the Control**
   - Start the test harness to test your control locally:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will open a browser window where you can interact with your control.

## Deploying the PCF

1. **Create a Solution**
   - Create a new solution in Power Platform if you don't have one already.

2. **Add the PCF Control to the Solution**
   - Navigate to the `dist` folder in your project directory.
   - Import the generated `.zip` file into your Power Platform solution.

3. **Publish the Solution**
   - After importing the control, publish the solution to make it available in your apps.

## Cloning the Repository and Reviewing the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
     ```
   - Replace `YourUsername` and `YourRepositoryName` with the appropriate values.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Change to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd YourRepositoryName
     ```

3. **Install Project Dependencies**
   - Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**
   - Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.
